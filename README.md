Heart Disease Prediction Project
Project Overview
This Python-based project aims to predict heart disease presence in patients using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset, the project applies data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and modeling techniques. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers were utilized, with Logistic Regression achieving an optimal accuracy of 87%. This work underscores the potential of machine learning in healthcare, facilitating early detection and preventive measures for heart disease.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip
Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Data Collection & Cleaning: Script to collect and clean the data, preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter notebook that provides insights into the dataset through visualization and statistical methods.
Feature Engineering & Selection: Techniques applied to select the most relevant features for the model.
Modeling: Application of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. The Logistic Regression model demonstrated the highest accuracy and is recommended for predicting heart disease presence.
To run the analysis, navigate to the project directory and execute the Jupyter notebooks in order:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
Replace <notebook_name> with the name of the notebook you wish to run.
